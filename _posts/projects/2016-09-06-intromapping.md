<p>This article is meant to provide an introductory over of how to become involved in humanitarian mapping. I’ve received more than a few questions recently about how I slid into GIS work this past year. When I first started working for REACH Initiative a few years ago, I really enjoyed the GIS teams and the work they did. I slowly taught myself here and there before taking on full time work with the Red Cross working on GIS mapping and IM systems. Below is a very short guide to help you get started if you’re interested. This should give you enough links to satisfy your curiosity and, if you want to, learn more on your own.</p>
