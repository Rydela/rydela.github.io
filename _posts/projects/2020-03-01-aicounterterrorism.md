<p>goFintel is the “NEXT Generation platform for Detecting, Preventing and Countering Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism” </p>
<br>
<p>This project is currently in development in collaboration with Omdena.</p>
<br>
<p>Under the framework of the UN Office of Counter Terrorism “UN-OICT-UNCCT Global coordinated programme on detecting, preventing and countering the financing of terrorism” addressing UN Security Council Resolution 2462 and 2482 mandates, the UN initiated the goFintel project with the aim to strengthen Member States capacity to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.</p>
<br>
<p>goFintel seeks to shift away from a siloed approach to intelligence and expand money laundering and terrorism financing investigation capabilities through analysis that spans multiple and different data sources. This approach enables Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) to rely on advanced information sharing, data transmission and retention, secure ICT architectures, and cross-functional operational capabilities with multiple stakeholders (e.g., law enforcement, judiciary, etc.).</p>
