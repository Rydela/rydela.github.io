<p>Part of the Go Project, this dashboard was created through Tableau to provide up to date information on projects occuring in the MENA region.

For continuity purposes, the link goes to the GitHub respository for it.

You can find the new IFRC MENA site here: https://go.ifrc.org/regions/4#operations</p>
