<p>Beginning in April 2020, I started assisting with the development of HXL Dash, an automated dashboard and map creation kit for humanitarians.</p>
<p>This project is hosted by the British Red Cross with support from the Humanitarian Data Exchange.</p>
<p>My work on the dashboard is in partnership with École supérieure d'ingénieurs Léonard-de-Vinci Paris, as a required work experience for my Masters in Engineering.</p>
