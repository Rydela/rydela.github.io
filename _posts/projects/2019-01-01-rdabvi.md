<p>Value for money is one of the strategic pillars of the Recovery and Development Agency in the Government of the Virgin Islands. After the monitoring and evaluation team created the VfM framework and began evaluating projects, we needed a way to visualize our progress and results to the public. This dashboard was created in order to communicate those results. It is in final stages of production and was released end of May 2020.</p>
