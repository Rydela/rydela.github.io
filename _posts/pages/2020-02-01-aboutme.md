  - title: "Ryan Arias Delafosse"
    role: "Humanitarian Data Scientist"
    intro: "I'm a humanitarian data scientist and statistician passionate about how we use data and human centered design in emergency response. Over the course of the past decade I've worked with the Red Cross, UN, NGOs, and governments in conflict and disaster relief in the Middle East, Latin America, and Caribbean. My work has ranged from multi-sector needs assessments, IT4D project management, complex value for money frameworks, to GIS mapping, machine learning, NLP algorithms, and data visualization. My name is Ryan Arias Delafosse and I develop processes, run assessments, and write code for humanitarian organisations. I like GIS mapping, human centered design, the genre of magic realism, and front-end development. I'm a happy contributor and volunteer to the Missing Maps project and CartONG. I try to write and post thoughts on Medium as well. If you want, you can get in touch. I'm available for freelance work and humanitarian design/mapping/project collaboration, or just to meet up over coffee, beer, or wine (I'm not picky)"
